# DevOps Intelligence Hub - Advanced Testing Prompts

## Enterprise Scenario Testing

### **Prompt 1: Crisis Management Scenario**
```
"We have a critical production incident. Our main application is down, users are reporting 500 errors, and the CEO is asking for immediate status. I need a comprehensive situation report covering infrastructure health, security implications, deployment status, and emergency rollback options. Also check if weather conditions might be affecting our data centres."
```

### **Prompt 2: Multi-Domain Intelligence Synthesis**
```
"Prepare for tomorrow's board meeting. I need an executive summary covering: current infrastructure performance metrics, security posture assessment, recent deployment success rates, any emergency actions taken this week, plus current time zones for our global operations. Present this as a unified intelligence briefing."
```

### **Prompt 3: Proactive Risk Assessment**
```
"Before we deploy the new microservices architecture next week, give me a complete risk assessment. Check infrastructure capacity, security compliance status, deployment pipeline health, and identify any potential rollback scenarios we should prepare for."
```

### **Prompt 4: Real-time Operations Dashboard**
```
"I'm the new DevOps manager starting today. Give me a complete operational overview: infrastructure status, security alerts, deployment pipeline health, recent emergency actions, current system time, and weather conditions at our primary data centre locations."
```

### **Prompt 5: Compliance Audit Preparation**
```
"We have a security audit tomorrow. Provide comprehensive documentation covering: infrastructure security posture, deployment security practices, emergency response procedures, and current operational status. Include timestamps for audit trail purposes."
```

## Architecture Complexity Validation

### **Prompt 6: Tool Orchestration Test**
```
"Demonstrate your multi-domain expertise by simultaneously: checking London weather (our primary DC), getting current UTC time for audit logs, generating infrastructure health report, performing security assessment, checking deployment pipeline status, and preparing emergency rollback procedures. Show how all these domains integrate for enterprise decision-making."
```

### **Prompt 7: Enterprise Integration Simulation**
```
"Act as the central intelligence hub for a Fortune 500 company. Coordinate information from infrastructure monitoring, security operations, deployment management, and crisis response teams. Provide a unified view that executives can use for strategic decisions."
```

## Performance & Scalability Testing

### **Prompt 8: High-Load Scenario**
```
"We're experiencing 10x normal traffic due to a viral marketing campaign. Rapidly assess: infrastructure capacity and performance, security implications of increased load, deployment rollback readiness, and provide emergency scaling recommendations."
```

### **Prompt 9: Multi-Region Coordination**
```
"Our global infrastructure spans London, New York, and Tokyo. Provide coordinated intelligence covering: weather conditions affecting each region, local times for incident coordination, infrastructure health across all regions, security status globally, and deployment synchronization status."
```

## Innovation & Presentation Testing

### **Prompt 10: Executive Briefing Simulation**
```
"I'm presenting our DevOps Intelligence Hub to the C-suite in 5 minutes. Demonstrate the system's capabilities by providing: real-time operational intelligence, security posture summary, deployment confidence metrics, crisis response readiness, and show how this unified platform reduces operational risk and improves decision-making speed."
